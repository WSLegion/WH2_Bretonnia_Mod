        - Active Ability, 180s CD, 60s Duration
        - While activated, unit cannot lose entity and will constantly recover health
        - Upon activation, unit will recover from fatigue
        - Comment: Even though their stats seem very decent, I still find them melting against low tier enemy units. This ability helps reducing the casualties taken if the combat is kept short.

  * Knight of the Realm
    * +5 Charge Bonus
    * +5 Anti-Large Bonus
## Stage 3
  * Foot Squire
    * +10 Melee Attack and Melee Defence
    * +20% Speed
    * +5 Anti-Infantry Bonus
    * Enable "Battle Formation"
      - Passive ability
      - Active if unit healt is above 75%
      - Unit gains +10 Melee Attack and Melee Defence while this ability is active
  * Knight of the Realm
    * +10 Charge Bonus
    * +10 Anti-Large Bonus
    * Enable "Perfect Vigour"
    * Enable "Close Quarter Combat"
      - One-off Ability
      - When activated, unit gains +14 Melee Attack and Melee Defence for the rest of the battle
      - However, unit will suffer from -20 Anti-Large Bonus and -40 Charge Bonus for the rest of the battle
      - Comment: This ability is supposed to represent Knights dropping their lance for Close Quarter Combat, as a result they lose their charge bonus and anti-large bonus for better melee capability. Obviously it will be very hard to recover their lance in the heat of the battle so this is a one-off decision.

      - Active ability, 60s Duration, 120s CD
      - Affects enemy units within 80 AOE, targetable ability
      - Affected units will suffer from -12 Morale and -40% Magic Resistance
      - Comment: Just in case you are going against some ridiculously high magic resistance.
  * Blessed Field Trebuchet

      - Bombardment ability

      - But the explosion radius is very small

      - Comment: Despite its name, it is not really guided toward enemy artillery pieces. You need to aim carefully to do successful artillery snipe. It will not do a lot damage against other unit types (Perhaps Infantry but still better used against artillery in my opinion).
